# WARNING!!!
#### Don't use this script if you don't understand how it works. Script like this will have full-access to your local lbrynet daemon, which means it can steal all your LBC, channels and publishes. Confirm yourself that this doesn't do that before running it.



### Info
Tampermonkey script. Tested on Firefox on Linux.  
Redirects video source from Odysee to your local lbynet daemon.  
This is not perfect, but may be interesting.  
Videos which have option to change quality, won't have that with this and video controls won't work on those videos.
